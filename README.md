# Underscore.js Demos

Boostrap site showcasing how to use a selected collection of Underscore.js functions.

This site was also built using npm to pull down Bootstrap, jQuery and Underscore.js and coded in Brackets.

The goal, aside from using Underscore, was to gain more experience in building sites with a different workflow and to develop skills using a newer front end development environment.
